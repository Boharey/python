# Bitwise Calculator
A simple command-line Bitwise Calculator implemented in Python. This calculator performs various bitwise operations including AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift, and bit manipulation (set, reset, toggle) on numbers input by the user in decimal, binary, or hexadecimal formats.

## Project Background
The Bitwise Calculator is designed to help users understand and practice bitwise operations commonly used in programming. It allows users to input numbers in different formats, including decimal, binary (prefixed with `0b`), and hexadecimal (prefixed with `0x`). The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive way to learn about bitwise operations and their practical applications, making it an ideal tool for eveyone to learn.

## Features
- **Input Conversion:** Accepts decimal, binary, and hexadecimal inputs. : input is initially in string format
- **Bitwise Operations:** Perform AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, and right shift operations.
- **Bit Manipulation:** Set, reset, and toggle bits in binary representation.
- **Display Results:** Shows results in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats.

## Getting Started
To get started, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine and a basic understanding of Python and command-line usage. To install the calculator, clone the repository and navigate to the cloned directory. Run the script by executing `python bitwise_calculator.py`.

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply run the script and enter the numbers you wish to perform operations on when prompted, using the appropriate prefixes: Decimal: `13`, Binary: `0b1101`, Hexadecimal: `0xD`. You will then be able to view the results of the bitwise operations displayed in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal formats. When prompted for bit manipulation, enter the bit position (0-indexed) you wish to set, reset, or toggle.
