Understanding *args and **kwargs in Python
Introduction

In Python, you may need to write functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. Python provides two special syntax features for this purpose: *args and **kwargs. These features allow your functions to handle an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, making your code more flexible and reusable.

This README will guide you through the usage of both *args and **kwargs, explain their syntax, and provide examples to help you understand them better.

1.What is *args?

    *args allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a tuple inside the function. The args name is not mandatory; you can use any name after the *, but args is the conventional name.
    Example:

    def greet(*args):
        """
        Greets each person passed as a positional argument.
        
        Args:
        *args: Variable number of positional arguments (names).
        """
        for name in args:
            print(f"Hello, {name}!")

    Usage:

    When you call the function greet(), you can pass any number of arguments, and the function will greet each one.

    greet("Utsav", "Mohit", "Sabin", "Safal")

    Output:

    Hello, Utsav!
    Hello, Mohit!
    Hello, Sabin!
    Hello, Safal!

    Explanation:

        The *args in the function signature allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments.
        Inside the function, args behaves like a tuple. You can loop through it or access individual elements like you would with a tuple.

2.What is **kwargs?

    **kwargs allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a dictionary inside the function. kwargs stands for "keyword arguments", and you can use any name instead of kwargs.
    Example:

    def print_info(**kwargs):
        """
        Prints the provided keyword arguments.
        
        Args:
        **kwargs: Variable number of keyword arguments (key-value pairs).
        """
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")

    Usage:

    You can call the function print_info() by passing arguments as key-value pairs, and the function will print each key and its corresponding value.

    print_info(name="Alice", age=25, city="New York")

    Output:

    name: Alice
    age: 25
    city: New York

    Explanation:

        The **kwargs in the function signature allows you to pass an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.
        Inside the function, kwargs behaves like a dictionary, where keys are the argument names, and values are the argument values.

3.Combining *args and **kwargs

    You can use both *args and **kwargs in the same function. This allows you to handle both positional and keyword arguments at the same time.
    Example:

    def display_info(*args, **kwargs):
        """
        Displays both positional and keyword arguments.
        
        Args:
        *args: Positional arguments.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments.
        """
        print("Positional arguments:")
        for arg in args:
            print(arg)
        
        print("Keyword arguments:")
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")

    Usage:

    You can pass both positional and keyword arguments to the function.

    display_info("Alice", "Bob", name="Charlie", age=30)

    Output:

    Positional arguments:
    Alice
    Bob
    Keyword arguments:
    name: Charlie
    age: 30

    Explanation:

        The *args collects the positional arguments, and **kwargs collects the keyword arguments.
        The function first prints the positional arguments, followed by the keyword arguments.

4.Key Takeaways

    *args: Allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments. These arguments are captured as a tuple.
    **kwargs: Allows a function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments. These arguments are captured as a dictionary.
    Both *args and **kwargs help create more flexible functions that can handle different numbers of arguments without changing the function's signature.
    You can use *args and **kwargs in the same function to handle both positional and keyword arguments simultaneously.

5.Conclusion

    By mastering *args and **kwargs, you can write more flexible, reusable, and maintainable Python functions. These features are essential for handling dynamic inputs in your programs, especially when working with functions that need to process variable amounts of data.

    The combination of positional arguments (*args) and keyword arguments (**kwargs) enables you to write functions that can easily adapt to various calling conventions.
